Custom HTMLElement - ```<graph-drawer>``` allows to visualize and edit graphs. This project is being developed by inexperienced person, so there are lots of bugs and wrong solutions. But... it is much better than nothing.

The project requires modern browser capabilities, such as ```import``` and ```export```, custom elements, etc.

Please give your feedback, especially if you know the right way to do some things.
